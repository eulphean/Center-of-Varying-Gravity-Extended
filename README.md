As part of the open-call by Martin gallery in Chicago, Amay Kataria participated in the fourth edition of the [LOCUS](https://www.locus.gallery/brianna-amay) show. [Center of (Varying) Gravity](https://covg.art) was developed for that exhibition. This work draws from the visual language of fractal patterns to create a generative-meditative simulation of light, and is a visual response to a writing prompt by Chicago based literary artist, Brianna Santina. It takes its point of departure in the context of unpredictability and readjustment to devise a symbol of courage and motivation to face the varying uncertainty. Due to its mathematical nature, the simulation evolves with time while refracting a myriad of colors that are inspired from the writerâ€™s description of a personal state of transformation during the Covid-19 lockdown in Chicago.
