# Center of (Varying) Gravity Extended
For the group show [Is It A Good Time](https://www.manacontemporary.com/event/is-it-a-good-time/) at Mana Contemporary, curated by Nicky Ni and Maryam Faridani, Amay Kataria extended his previous project [Center of (Varying) Gravity](https://github.com/eulphean/Center-of-Varying-Gravity) to create a generative video work. This was developed by creating multiple iterations of the original shader, recording image sequences from it, and compiling it into a moving image narrative. The sound was created using a generative audio patch developed in [VCV Rack](https://vcvrack.com/).


This original work was developed as part of the open-call by Martin gallery in Chicago where Amay Kataria participated in the fourth edition of the [LOCUS](https://www.locus.gallery/brianna-amay) show. [Center of (Varying) Gravity](https://covg.art) was developed for that exhibition. This work draws from the visual language of fractal patterns to create a generative-meditative simulation of light, and is a visual response to a writing prompt by Chicago based literary artist, Brianna Santina. It takes its point of departure in the context of unpredictability and readjustment to devise a symbol of courage and motivation to face the varying uncertainty. Due to its mathematical nature, the simulation evolves with time while refracting a myriad of colors that are inspired from the writerâ€™s description of a personal state of transformation during the Covid-19 lockdown in Chicago.
